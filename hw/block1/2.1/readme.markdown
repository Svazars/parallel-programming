# Task 2.1

## 2.1.a

Is it possible that some exception would happen **inside** `Lock.lock` or `Lock.unlock` method? Justify your answer by using precise `chapter.section` number from Java Language Specification.

**Hint**: `sqrt[3]{1331}$` is good magic number.

## 2.1.b

Is it possible to design ''bullet-proof'' (w.r.t. exceptions) concurrency primitives in Java language? Justify your answer by using precise JDK Enhancement Proposal number.

**Hint**: `sqrt{72900}` is good magic number, too.

## Requirements

Explain **your opinion** on the subject, just citing JLS/JEP is not enough. Be ready to answer additional questions related to sporadic system exceptions in virtual machine.
