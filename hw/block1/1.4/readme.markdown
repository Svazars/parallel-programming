# Task 1.4

## Description

1. Programmer enhances a part of the code that represents `10%` of the total execution time.
This part starts to work `10 000` times faster. What is total speedup of a program?

2. Problem could be split into two parts: A and B. A is serial, B is parallel. On single CPU, A
takes `50` minutes, B takes `250` minutes. How many CPUs do you need to solve the problem in `100` minutes (achieve `3x` speed-up)?

3. Prepare an example where `10x` speed-up could be achieved by using `100` CPUs only.

## Requirements

Provide answers and **explanation** for all three problems. Single number without additional information will not be treated as a correct solution.
